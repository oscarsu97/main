== Introduction

Plan^2^Travel is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for planning an overseas trip*. More importantly, Plan^2^Travel is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Plan^2^Travel can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `plan2travel.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Plan^2^Travel.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* *`help`* : a list of commands available on Plan^2^Travel
* **`add act`**`n/Visit Gundam Museum a/Tokyo p/65543221` : adds an activity named `Visit Gundam Museum` at location `Tokyo` with contact number `65543221` to the activity list.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Eat lunch t/Western` or as `n/Eat lunch`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Any two items enclosed within with `()` and has a `||` lying between them indicates that either one of the items has to be present.
