== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design


[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponent.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `ActivityListPanel`, `AccomodationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a contact).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add activity n/Climb Fuji a/Mount Fuji")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add activity n/Climb Fuji a/Mount Fuji` Command
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* application data is split into 4 different components, `Accommodation`, `Activity`, `Contact`, `Itinerary`.
* can save `Accommodation` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Activity` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Contact` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Itinerary` objects in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete contact 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add contact n/David ...` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following accommodation diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== [Proposed] Schedule optimisation
==== Proposed Implementation

The proposed schedule optimisation feature utilises `TimeTable` and allows the user to schedule multiple activities within the same time slot. The following command is supported:

* optimise budget INDEX_OF_DAY -- optimises and brings activities with the lowest cost into focus. This operation supports activities with or without a cost. Activities without a cost has a default cost of $0.00.


Given below is a sample usage of the proposed feature:

Step 1. User adds an activity with a cost:

* `add activity n/lunch a/KFC c/5.00`

Step 2. User adds another activity without a cost:

* `add activity n/go for a walk a/park`

Step 3. User schedules the first activity into a day:

* `schedule activity 1 st/1300 et/1400 d/1`

Step 4. User schedules the second activity into the same day:

* `schedule activity 2 st/1300 et/1400 d/1`

Step 6. User executes `optimise budget` command. The activities in that day would be shown in a way such that the activities with the lowest costs are in focus.

Shown below is a summary of the execution of the command.

image::OptimiseSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
Aspect: How version comparison is executed:

* Alternative 1(current choice): user overload each time slot.

** Pros: User can save time by overloading a single day's schedule.

** Cons: UI might get very cluttered when a single time slot has too many activities.

* Alternative 2: user create copies of each day and choose which they prefer.

** Pros: UI is neater, each day would not look too crammed.

** Cons: May have a lot of permutations which is tedious for user to optimise.

=== [Proposed] Schedule Activity feature

*_Plan²travel_* allows user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time slot of a day. They can be indicated
by using the Schedule Command with index of the activity from activity list, index of the day from the list of days in Itinerary,
start time and end time of the activity.

Eg. `schedule activity ACTIVITY_INDEX st/START_TIME et/END_TIME d/DAY_INDEX`

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `ScheduleCommandParser` which converts the string
variable of start time and end time into a LocalTime format and wraps activity index and day index  with an Index class.
These are then passed on to the `ScheduleActivityCommand` for execution later on.

Given below is a sequence diagram showing the creation of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram showing how ScheduleActivityCommand is created.
image::ScheduleActivityCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of `ScheduleActivityCommand`, `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `ScheduleActivityCommand`.

Below are the steps taken during the execution of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

    1. `Model` will get the list of days from the `Itinerary` and the list of activities from  `UniqueActivityList`.

    2. The `activityIndex` and `dayIndex` will then be used to obtain the target `Activity` from activity list
and target `Day` from list of days.

    3. `Activity` will be converted to `ActivityWithTime` using the start time and time given.

    4. This `ActivityWithTime` is then added to the list of `ActivityWithTime` for the target `Day`.

    5. A new `Day` is created with the updated list of `ActivityWithTime`.

    6. Model will replace the old `Day` with the new `Day` created in the `Itinerary`.

Given below is a sequence diagram showing the execution of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram showing how ScheduleActivityCommand executes.
image::ScheduleActivityExecution.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Update activities for that particular day

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new Day class with updated activity list for that day.
** Pros: Easier for developer to test the code.
** Cons: Might create unnecessary overheads in the code by creating new object every time we schedule an activity.
* **Alternative 2:** Directly updates the activity list in the current Day class.
** Pros: Seem more intuitive and simple to implement.
** Cons: Might make it harder to debug if other functions/classes also depends on the same Day class.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Timetable

==== Current Implementation

Internally, Timetable is a TreeSet of ActivityWithTime. This allows fast access of ActivityWithTime stored in Timetable as well as giving Timetable the flexibility to accept Activities that start and end at any time instead of fixed intervals (e.g. 30 minute intervals).

To be precise, comparison between ActivityWithTime in the TreeSet is done by comparing their start times. To prevent overlapping activities, checks will be conducted before the adding. The start time of an ActivityWithTime that is added will not be before the end time of its floor neighbour and it's end time will not be after the start time of its ceiling neighbour.

==== Design considerations
* Alternative 1: an Array of time slots that stores Activity

** Pros: Simple and intuitive to implement. UI for itinerary is easier to implement too. Very fast access to each Activity in the Timetable.

** Cons: Constrained to fixed intervals. Hence, Activity start times and end times have to be in multiples of the fixed interval.

* Alternative 2(current choice): a TreeSet of ActivityWithTime

** Pros: Allows flexible start times and end times. Fast access to Activity in Timetable. Does not allow ActivityWithTime objects to have the same start times.

** Con: UI for itinerary might be difficult to implement as each the size of each block of ActivityWithTime in the UI is not the same.
